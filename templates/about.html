    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
    also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
    superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
    business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth, he
            and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in
            exile, he
            quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of
            Azanulbizar in
            TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the
            fighting, his
            shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet
            "Oakenshield,"
            which would remain with him even in death.

        <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews
            of
            Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose,
            the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

        <h3>Óin</h3>
        <p>
            Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and younger
            brother of Óin.
        
            In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves
            and Orcs, though it is unknown how significant his contribution was, being 16 years old.
        
            In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March of TA
            2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so
            that Smaug wouldn't ally with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned Hobbits, Glóin referred them as "simpletons" and also
            said that Hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell".
